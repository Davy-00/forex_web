                <p className="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
                  Forex trading involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for all investors. The high degree
                  of leverage can work against you as well as for you. Before deciding to invest in forex, you should
                  carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
                  The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and
                  therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the
                  risks associated with forex trading and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have
                  any doubts.
